// Write your answer to Problem 1 (b) here

//create MEM-EX forwarding and EX-EX forwarding

p1-1: 
I create a RAW hazard for $r4, the forwarding take place in EX-EX.
Since $r4 will be available at the execution stage of add instruction, 
$r4 will be read at the execution stage of seq instruction.

p1-2:
I create a RAW hazard for $r2, the forwarding take place in MEM-EX.
Since $r2 will be available at the memory stage of ld instruction,
$r2 will be available at execution stage of seq instruction

p1-3:
I create RAW hazards for $r2 and $r3, the forwarding take place in both EX-EX and MEM-EX.
Since $r3 will be available at the execution stage of sub instruction,
$r2 will be available at the memory stage of ld instruction,
$r2 and $r3 will be available at execution stage of seq instruction.
